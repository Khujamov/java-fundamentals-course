Improve your Java SE skills
### Task
`Queue` is an API that represents queue data structure that follows "first in, first out" rule (FIFO). Your job is to 
implement the *todo* section of the class `LinkedQueue`. Please note, that your implementation should be based on liked 
 queue, e.g. linked nodes. It means that you should create your own class `Node<T>` that will hold queue elements.
  
To verify your implementation, run `QueueTest.java`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar Queue data structure, and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and create a branch **exercise/your_username** if you want your code to be reviewed
* Start implementing the **todo** section and verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
